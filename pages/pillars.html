    <h1>Three Pillars: A Simple Metamodel</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to your first metamodel! You could probably also call it something like a framework. The Three Pillars model is a way of decomposing processes into a few high level ideas. Once a process is parsed into the three pillars, it can be much easier to find adjacent processes and free parameters within the process. Onward to the three pillars then: seed, update, and render.
    </p>

    <h2>Seed</h2>
    <p>
        The seed defines the initial conditions of our data. Before now we've seen examples of initial conditions making an impact on the result, for example when we seeded our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/pages/diffusion">diffusion process</a> with random noise, a checkerboard, or an image.
    </p>

    <h2>Update</h2>
    <p>
        An update determines how the system changes over time. It is a function that takes the current state and returns a new state (of the same type). We've seen several update rules on the same kind of data (a set of points) as defining different <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/pages/growth">growth processes</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Render</h2>
    <p>
        This is how we draw the data. It can define shape, color, or more complicated things like a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation">composite operation</a>. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Example: Chasing Points</h2>
    <p>
        Play around with the three pillars in the simple example below. We start with some number of random points in a cyclic graph (Seed). At each step each point moves closer to its neighbor (Update), then we draw a white dot at each point (Render).

    <h2>Example: Process 13 (Points with Metadata)</h2>
    <p>
        Initialize points in a circle (Seed) where each one also has some metadata: a radius and velocity. Update each point by moving it in the direction of its velocity. Render a line connecting any two points that overlap given their radii. Play with the variations! (Thanks to <a href="http://reas.com/compendium_lecture/">REAS</a> for this base process.)
